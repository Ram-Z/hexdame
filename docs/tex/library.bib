@inproceedings{Franca2012,
abstract = {In this paper we introduce a method and algorithm for ILP learning using neural networks, by extending a neural-symbolic system called C-ILP (Garcez and Zaverucha, 1999). It is a neural-symbolic sys- tem that uses a background knowledge encoded as an initial propositional logic program to build a recurrent neural network and furthermore, uses examples to apply standard back-propagation learning. This integration inherited both parallel learning from neural networks and explanatory power from propositional logic. We will use the most specific clause of ILP systems that are based on Inverse Entailment, called Bottom Clause, to allow learning with neural networks. More precisely, Bottom Clauses will be generated for each training example and then, applied on an adapted version of C-ILP. Experimental comparisons with a traditional ILP system, Aleph, will be made using alzheimers benchmarks and the results show that our neural-symbolic approach for First-Order Logic has similar classification accuracy but it is considerably faster.},
